# 🌌 Orion — Engineer with a Mathematics Foundation, Building Toward AI Systems

Hi, I’m **Orion** — an engineer with a background in mathematics, operational IT, CRM systems, and data analysis. I’ve worked hands‑on with **Dynamics 365**, **SQL**, **Power Platform**, **Python**, and automation in professional environments, and I’m now actively developing my software engineering and AI skillset through focused personal projects.

My work is shaped by three things:

- **a mathematical way of thinking**  
- **a focus on clarity, structure, and maintainability**  
- **a long‑term direction toward applied AI and automation**

I approach engineering through minimal assumptions, clear constraints, and iterative refinement toward stable, predictable systems.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

A set of projects that reflect how I think and how I solve problems:

### **📐 Mathematical Foundations for Computing**  
Work exploring how minimal mathematical structures can clarify system behaviour, stability, and evolution. I’m interested in how formal assumptions, constraint structures, and coherence conditions can help us reason about complex systems, build more reliable software, and design models that behave predictably under refinement. This sits at the intersection of mathematics, computing, and system design.

### **🤖 ML & Automation Experiments**  
Lightweight classifiers, tagging tools, and prototypes exploring applied machine learning and automation using Python.

### **📘 R Knowledgebase**  
A reproducible R cleaning and reporting workflow, focused on clarity and future‑proofing.

### **📦 SQL Knowledgebase**  
A structured reference for SQL cleaning, transformation, and workflow design, built from real operational experience.

### **🧱 Systems & Architecture**  
Projects exploring clean folder structures, reproducible environments, and maintainable engineering patterns.

These projects show my approach to learning, problem‑solving, and building reliable systems.

## 🧠 What I Bring

- A **mathematician’s approach** to problem‑solving  
- Experience supporting and developing **Dynamics 365** and **Power Platform** systems  
- Hands‑on work with **Python**, **SQL**, **R**, **Power BI**, and automation  
- A strong grounding in **security**, **GDPR**, and operational reliability  
- Clear communication, documentation, and stakeholder engagement  
- A habit of building systems that are **clean, modular, and reproducible**

## 🚀 Where I’m Heading

I’m strengthening the skills that support applied AI engineering, including:

- data pipelines  
- model evaluation  
- automation  
- reproducible workflows  
- system design  
- applied ML in real organisations  

My experience with Dynamics 365 introduced me to system integrations, data flows, and operational constraints — all of which inform the engineering foundations I’m building now.

I’m particularly interested in system‑level AI engineering: how models behave, how they integrate with real workflows, and how to build reliable, interpretable, and maintainable AI‑driven systems.

## 🔄 How I Work

I follow an iterative, refinement‑driven workflow focused on clarity, correctness, and maintainability.

- I use version control to track conceptual changes, not just code edits.  
- I maintain reproducible environments (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `renv`, or structured project templates).  
- I validate small components before integrating them, favouring correctness over premature optimisation.  
- I document assumptions, constraints, and decisions as part of the build process.  
- I occasionally use AI tools for structure or syntax, while retaining full ownership of the design and reasoning.  
- I aim for deterministic, transparent workflows that can be understood and reused by others.

This approach reflects my mathematical background and my long‑term direction toward AI engineering.

## 🎯 Current Focus

Right now, I’m concentrating on:

- strengthening Python engineering patterns  
- building reproducible ML and data workflows  
- formalising mathematical tools for reasoning about systems  

These threads all converge toward my broader goal of designing reliable, interpretable AI systems grounded in solid mathematical principles.

## 🧭 Values

I value clarity, correctness, reproducibility, and transparent reasoning in everything I build.
