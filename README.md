# 🌌 Orion — Engineer with a mathematics foundation, building toward AI systems

Hi, I’m Orion — an engineer with a background in mathematics, operational IT, CRM systems, and data analysis. I’ve worked hands‑on with Dynamics 365, SQL, Power Platform, and automation in my professional roles, and I’m now actively developing my software engineering and AI skillset through focused personal projects.

My work is shaped by three things:

- **a mathematical way of thinking**  
- **a focus on clarity, structure, and maintainability**  
- **a long‑term direction toward applied AI and automation**

I’m focused on building the skills and understanding needed for AI engineering.

## 🔧 What I’m working on
I’m currently developing a set of projects that reflect how I think and how I solve problems:

### **📦 SQL Knowledgebase**  
A structured reference for SQL cleaning, transformation, and workflow design, built from real operational experience.

### **📘 R Knowledgebase**  
A reproducible R cleaning and reporting workflow, focused on clarity and future‑proofing.

### **🤖 ML & Automation Experiments**  
Lightweight classifiers, tagging tools, and prototypes exploring applied machine learning and automation.

### **🧱 Systems & Architecture**  
Projects exploring clean folder structures, reproducible environments, and maintainable engineering patterns.

These projects show my approach to learning, problem‑solving, and building reliable systems

## 🧠 What I bring
- A **mathematician’s approach** to problem‑solving  
- Experience supporting and developing **Dynamics 365** and **Power Platform** systems  
- Hands‑on work with **SQL**, **Python**, **R**, **Power BI**, and **automation**  
- A strong grounding in **security**, **GDPR**, and **operational reliability**  
- Clear communication, documentation, and stakeholder engagement  
- A habit of building systems that are **clean, modular, and reproducible**

## 🚀 Where I’m heading
My current direction involves strengthening skills that support applied AI, such as:

- data pipelines  
- model evaluation  
- automation  
- reproducible workflows  
- system design  
- applied ML in real organisations  

My experience with Dynamics 365 introduced me to system integrations, data flows, and operational constraints — all of which inform the engineering foundations I’m building now.
