# 🌌 Orion — Engineer with a mathematics foundation, building toward AI systems

Hi, I’m Orion — an engineer with a background in mathematics, operational IT, CRM systems, and data analysis. I’ve spent the last few years working hands‑on with Dynamics 365, SQL, Power Platform, and automation, while steadily expanding my software engineering and AI skillset through personal projects.

My work is shaped by three things:

- **a mathematical way of thinking**  
- **a focus on clarity, structure, and maintainability**  
- **a long‑term goal of building and supporting AI‑driven systems**

I’m not trying to “look like” an AI engineer — I’m building the foundations properly.

## 🔧 What I’m working on
I’m currently developing a set of projects that reflect how I think and how I solve problems:

### **📦 SQL Knowledgebase**  
A structured reference for SQL cleaning, transformation, and workflow design, built from real operational experience.

### **📘 R Knowledgebase**  
A reproducible R cleaning and reporting workflow, focused on clarity and future‑proofing.

### **🤖 ML & Automation Experiments**  
Lightweight classifiers, tagging tools, and prototypes exploring applied machine learning and automation.

### **🧱 Systems & Architecture**  
Projects exploring clean folder structures, reproducible environments, and maintainable engineering patterns.

These aren’t “portfolio pieces” — they’re working documents of my learning and engineering practice.

## 🧠 What I bring
- A **mathematician’s approach** to problem‑solving  
- Experience supporting and developing **Dynamics 365** and **Power Platform** systems  
- Hands‑on work with **SQL**, **Python**, **R**, **Power BI**, and **automation**  
- A strong grounding in **security**, **GDPR**, and **operational reliability**  
- Clear communication, documentation, and stakeholder engagement  
- A habit of building systems that are **clean, modular, and reproducible**

## 🚀 Where I’m heading
I’m steadily moving toward **AI engineering**, with a focus on:

- data pipelines  
- model evaluation  
- automation  
- reproducible workflows  
- system design  
- applied ML in real organisations  

Dynamics engineering is part of that journey — it’s given me experience with complex systems, integrations, and real‑world data challenges.
